# Pitch
* Provincial wide neonatal Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening
  uses hand written forms and snail mail to ensure that screening has
  been completed and completed correctly.

* We have created a mobile application that:
    * That replaces the paper forms
    * Applies the screening algorithm in realtime
    * Transmits the data back to a server

* We have also added:
    * Tracking of nurse users and devices to assist in QA
    * Alerts to ensure screens are done on time

* Newborn Screening Ontario is funded by the Province of Ontario. They
  have resources to improve the current screening process via mobile
  technology.

* ASK: You tell me? Time, money, fast cars...
